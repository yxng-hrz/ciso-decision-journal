# CISO Positioning & Authority Model

## Reporting Line
The CISO reports to the CIO, with a direct escalation channel to the CEO and Board.

## Authority
- Veto power on critical production risks
- Ownership of incident response
- Authority to define minimum security requirements

## Limitations
- No direct ownership of IT or product budgets
- No operational management of dev teams

## Structural Tension
Security introduces friction by design.
The CISO role is to manage this friction responsibly, not remove it.
