# CISO Decision Journal & Risk Mapping

## Overview
This repository presents a **complete, realistic CISO-level governance project**.
It demonstrates how cybersecurity decisions are made at executive level under
business, regulatory, and budget constraints.

This is **not a technical tooling project**.
It is a **decision, risk, and leadership project**.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate risk-based security governance
- Show executive communication skills
- Illustrate realistic trade-offs and accountability
- Position the author for RSSI / CISO roles

## Company Context (Fictional)
- B2B SaaS company
- 120 employees
- EU-based cloud hosting
- Processes personal and contractual data
- Strong growth and customer pressure

## Repository Structure
- `risk-mapping.md` – Enterprise risk assessment

## Core Philosophy
