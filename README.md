# CISO Real-World Portfolio (Complete)

This repository is a **full, end-to-end CISO portfolio** combining:
- cybersecurity governance documents
- executive decision records
- risk management artifacts
- light but meaningful supporting code

This project demonstrates how a **technical background evolves into CISO-level leadership**.

> A CISO does not eliminate risk.  
> A CISO makes risk visible, understandable, and consciously accepted.
